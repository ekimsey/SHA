    "## 1. INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "This Standard specifies secure hash algorithms, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256. All of the algorithms are iterative, one-way hash functions that can process a message to produce a condensed representation called a message digest. These algorithms enable the determination of a message’s integrity: any change to the message will, with a very high probability, result in a different message digest. This property is useful in the generation and verification of digital signatures and message authentication codes, and in the generation of random numbers or bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each algorithm can be described in two stages: preprocessing and hash computation. Preprocessing involves padding a message, parsing the padded message into m-bit blocks, and setting initialization values to be used in the hash computation. The hash computation generates a message schedule from the padded message and uses that schedule, along with functions, constants, and word operations to iteratively generate a series of hash values. The final hash value generated by the hash computation is used to determine the message digest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms differ most significantly in the security strengths that are provided for the data being hashed. The security strengths of these hash functions and the system as a whole when each of them is used with other cryptographic algorithms, such as digital signature algorithms and keyed-hash message authentication codes, can be found in \\[SP 800-57\\] and \\[SP 800-107\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the algorithms differ in terms of the size of the blocks and words of data that are\n",
    "used during hashing or message digest sizes. Figure 1 presents the basic properties of these hash\n",
    "algorithms.\n",

    "1. A *hex digit* is an element of the set {`0, 1,…, 9, a,…, f`}. A hex digit is the representation of a 4-bit string. For example, the hex digit “`7`” represents the 4-bit string “`0111`”, and the hex digit “`a`\" represents the 4-bit string “`1010`”.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A word is a $w$-bit string that may be represented as a sequence of hex digits. To convert a word to hex digits, each 4-bit string is converted to its hex digit equivalent, as described in (1) above. For example, the 32-bit string\n",

    " *Throughout this specification, the “big-endian” convention is used when expressing both 32- and 64-bit words, so that within each word, the most significant bit is stored in the left-most bit position.*\n",

    "3. An integer may be represented as a word or pair of words. A word representation of the message length,\n",
    "$\\ell$, in bits, is required for the padding techniques of Sec. 5.1. An integer between $0$ and $2^{32}-1$ *inclusive* may be represented as a 32-bit word. The least significant four bits of the integer are represented by the right-most hex digit of the word representation. For example, the integer $291 = 2^{8} + 2^{5} + 2^{1} + 2^{0} = 256 + 32 + 2 + 1$ is represented by the hex word “`00000123`”.\n",

Since $X$ and $Y$ can be represented as 32-bit words $x$ and $y$, respectively, the integer $Z$ can be represented as the pair of words $(x, y)$. This property is used for SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256.\n",

In such cases, a truncated message digest may be used, whereby a hash function with a larger message digest length is applied to the data to be hashed, and the resulting message digest is truncated by selecting an appropriate number of the leftmost bits.
